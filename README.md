# 📖Cryptocurrency Data Explorer

<a name="about-project"></a>

# Cryptocurrency Data Explorer

The crypto currency data explorer app is a powerful tool that allows users to delve deep into the world of digital currencies. With real-time updates and advanced analytical tools, this app provides a comprehensive view of the cryptocurrency market, allowing users to make informed decisions about their investments.

When the homepage is loaded, the user can view a list of various currencies that they can filter based on the currency name. Upon selecting a particular currency, the user is redirected to a details page that retrieves comprehensive information from the API associated with the selected coin.

The application is constructed using React, Redux, and CSS, leveraging the Redux Thunk middleware to manage asynchronous actions and the Fetch API to access data from the NAPI. Moreover, the application is entirely responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes and devices.
